## Entities

Entities are protected. Entities are protected. All have [property type](../../README.md#property-types) `Text`.
The table below lists all available entities:

| Value         | Explanation                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| "Unpublished" | Not published (eg. not discoverable) |
| "Published"   | Published (eg. discoverable)         |

**Note:**
Although this could easily be replaced property type `Bool`, it was decided to use `Text` so that additional values can be added to later schemas with backwards compatibility.
